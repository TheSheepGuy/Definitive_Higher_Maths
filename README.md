## Download - How to Get the Book
Right now the book isn't finished, but once it is you can download it by going to the releases tab. For now, you can compile it using your favourite LaTeX compiler.

## Using This Book
You are free to use this book for any purpose. Yes, that means you can photocopy it, and use it in classrooms. It's licensed under CC0, that means it's in the public domain, or in other words, there is no copyright on it.

## Contributing
You are free to create a pull request if you believe that you could improve the book in any way. The biggest reason for me making this book public is to get the best kind of examples possible, by allowing many people to make suggestions the likelihood that the examples will be clearer and more effective is a lot greater.

Please make sure you're following the convention that has been used already, namely:
* Indent the code using tabs, for example between `\begin{}` and `\end{}`.
* Leave an empty line in between paragraphs, this makes the code more legible. If an equation belongs to a paragraph, do not leave an empty line, if it does not, leave one.
* Only number important equations, the ones that should be remembered or can be found in the formula sheet, should be numbered. Write all other equations using `equation*` or `align*`.
* Write variables such as $x$ and $y$ as math (so in between \$dollar signs\$.)
* Leave an empty line before a subsection, two empty lines before a section.
* Each chapter is in its own file.
