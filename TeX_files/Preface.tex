\chapter{Preface}
Because of many things that were supposed to happen in 2020, I decided that it's a better idea to leave this project unfinished. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic the SQA exams were cancelled. There are other resources that have been written, albeit not in such a pretty \LaTeX format, available already which have been tried and tested before; the one that I immediately think of is the \href{https://www.hsn.uk.net/higher-maths/notes/}{Higher Still Notes}\footnote{Available online under \url{https://www.hsn.uk.net/higher-maths/notes/}.}, also written by former Higher Maths students.

That leaves the question, why is this document still up? Well, maybe it'll still be useful for certain pupils, maybe it'll be useful for people wanting to learn \LaTeX. If you wish to finish this, then please feel free to do so! You can fork this repository and do whatever with it, it's licensed under CC0 --- and if you're somehow reading a printed copy and have no idea what I'm talking about, then you can visit \url{https://github.com/TheSheepGuy/Open_Higher_Maths}.
