\section{Distance Formula}
The Distance Formula allows us to find the distance between two points given their Cartesian coordinates. To do this we treat the line between the two points as though it were the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, and use Pythagoras' theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.

DIAGRAM GOES HERE.

To find each side we simply take the difference between the two $x$-coordinates $y$-coordinates, and substitute into Pythagoras' theorem.

Pythagoras' theorem:
\begin{equation*}
	a^2 = b^2+c^2
\end{equation*}

Rearranged, with our method to find the distances:
\begin{equation*}
	d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}
\end{equation*}
